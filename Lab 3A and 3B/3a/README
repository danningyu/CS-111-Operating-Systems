This lab contains the files lab3a.c, a Makefile, and this README. 
lab3a.c takes in one argument, the name of a file system image, and 
prints its analysis to stdout. 

First, there is a superblock summary, which lists the total number of blocks, 
inodes, block size, inode size, blocks per group, inodes per group, and the 
first non-reserved inode. 

Next, there is a group summary, which lists the group number, total number
of blocks in this group, total number of inodes in this group, number of free
blocks, free inodes, the block number of free block bitmaps, block number of 
free inode bitmap, and the block number of the first block of inodes in this group. 
Then, there are free block entries and free inode entries, which just lists free block 
numbers and free inode numbers. 

Next, there is the inode summary, which lists the inode number, file type, mode, 
owner, group, link count, time of last inode change, modification time, time of last
access, file size, and number off blocks of disk space the file takes up. 

Then, there are directory entires, which print the parent inode number, logical 
byte offset, inode number of the referenced file, entry length, name length, and the 
name. 

Lastly, there are indirect block references, which list the inode number of the owning
file, the level of indirection for the scanned block, its logical block offset, the 
block number of the indirect block being scanned, and the block number of the referenced block.  

The Makefile has targets default, to compile the program; dist to create the deliverable
tarball, and clean to delete everything outputted by the Makefile.
