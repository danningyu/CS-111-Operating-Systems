Files: lab3b.py, lab3b.sh, a Makefile, and this README.

The python program takes in a .csv file, and analyzes it for, and prints out, inconsistencies. 
It checks for invalid blocks (block numbers that are out of bounds), blocks that are 
not on the free block list or allocated to a single file (unreferenced blocks), allocated blocks
that are also found on the free list, and blocks that are referenced by multiple files or times. 

For inodes, it also checks if it is valid (within bounds) or if it is unallocated. Next, it checks if 
there are allocated inodes on the freelist, and if there are unallocated inodes not on the free list. 
It also compares reference counts and number of discovered links for every inode. Lastly, it checks
if the inodes named '.' and '..' links correctly to itself and its parent, respectively. 

The shell script lab3b.sh simply contains a command to build and run the python program. 

The Makefile has a "default" target which runs the bash script, "dist" to create the tarball, and 
"clean" to remove the executable and tarball.
